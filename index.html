    <div class="container" id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Crusades were a series of religious and military campaigns initiated by the Christian states of Europe during the medieval period. Taking place between the 11th and 13th centuries, the primary objective of the Crusades was to reclaim Jerusalem and other holy sites from Muslim control. The most renowned Crusades occurred between 1096 and 1291, but smaller campaigns continued for centuries.</p>
        <p>The term "Crusade" is derived from the Latin word <em>crux</em>, meaning "cross," symbolizing the Christians' belief that they were fighting for their faith. The Crusaders were motivated by religious devotion, the promise of spiritual rewards, and a desire for wealth and adventure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container" id="causes">
        <h2>Causes of the Crusades</h2>
        <p>Several factors contributed to the launch of the Crusades, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Religious Motivation:</strong> The Catholic Church called for the liberation of Jerusalem, which had been under Muslim control since 638 AD. Pope Urban II urged Christians to take up arms to reclaim the Holy Land.</li>
            <li><strong>Political and Social Factors:</strong> European nobles sought new lands and titles, while the Church aimed to increase its influence and unite warring factions under a common cause.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Incentives:</strong> Merchants saw an opportunity to expand trade routes and gain access to valuable Eastern goods such as spices and silk.</li>
            <li><strong>Military Motivation:</strong> The Byzantine Empire, threatened by the Seljuk Turks, requested military assistance from Western Europe, prompting Pope Urban II to respond.</li>
            <li><strong>Promise of Salvation:</strong> Crusaders were promised forgiveness of sins and eternal salvation if they participated in the holy war.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
